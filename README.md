**Coding Standards**

uniblock adheres to the [WordPress coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/). To optionally test standards locally, you will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) on your machine. Run `composer install` to install test-specific development dependencies. The following commands are available:

- `composer run lint` Checks all PHP files for syntax errors
- `composer run standards:check` Checks all PHP files for standards errors
- `composer run standards:fix` Attempts to automatically fix all PHP standards errors
